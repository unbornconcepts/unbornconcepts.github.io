Here at Unborn Concepts we are big believers in modern web technologies and open source.  We build many of our solutions on NodeJS and Backbone.  Recently our founder created [Backbone.Composer](https://github.com/nnance/backbone-composer) a useful Backbone plug-in that makes the rendering and composing complex Backbone views easier.

At Unborn Concepts we believe in the simplicity and flexibility of Backbone.  Several of our customers have applications built in Backbone and we thought it would be valuable to bring this to your attention.  Some good resources include:

* [Usage](https://github.com/nnance/backbone-composer/wiki/usage)
* [Slides](http://slides.com/nicknance/composer/)
* [API](https://github.com/nnance/backbone-composer/wiki/api)
